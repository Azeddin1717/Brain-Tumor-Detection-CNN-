# Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN-
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect brain tumors from computed tomographyvimages. The model was trained on a large database of annotated images, and was successfully evaluated for accuracy and recall. The implementation was done using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
